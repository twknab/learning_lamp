# LAMP Ecommerce

Just a simple little ecommerce demo (no actual payment gateway setup). Users can add products to their cart, or remove them. Inventory management is included. Upon first page load, 5 demo products are created in the DB.

Ideas for improving:
+ Improve the Db design for actual order tracking.
+ Add in login/registration and modify Db accordingly.
+ Add in Stripe API to actually be able to process payments.
