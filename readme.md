# Learning the LAMP Stack

This repository takes us from the beginnings of PHP through full LAMP stack applications. As this is a learning repository, and undergoing changes, content here may fluctuate greatly until final completion of all learning assignments. At that point, additions or revisions may be made with time, along with this readme being updated.

## Organization

Please see the various sub-folders, numbered in their progression, for learning lessons and assignments. In each section, assignments are stored within a `assignments`. Note not every assignment may have an explanation included (this was a guided course), but I always strive for good notes and commenting within my code, and in many cases, do include explanations. Feel free to create a pull request with any new ideas, tips or errors or improvements you might have for me. Thank you!
