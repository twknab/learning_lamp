# The Wall (PHP and MySQL)

This is just a really simple project using MySQL and PHP to build a message-board. Nothing fancy and no fancy stylings. See wireframe for the mockup.

## Note:
There's a reason ORMs were invented. Writing lots of SQL queries can be boring and not the most efficient, compared to what you've done with NoSQL and aggregating records, etc. There is probably a cleaner way to use the SQL in this assignment, but for previty and to focus on the core learning lesson, I kept it simple.
